# 🎓 Manipal Vimeo Transcript Downloader

This is a simple Chrome extension I (Akki) built to help students in the **Manipal Online Degree Program** download and save transcripts from Vimeo videos used in the learning portal.

It extracts:
- ✅ **Subtitles (.vtt)** — original caption file from Vimeo  
- ✅ **Transcript (.txt)** — plain text without timestamps  
- ✅ **Cleaned Text** — grouped into full readable sentences (like human notes!)

## 🐾 Why I Made This

> I’m Akki, a student and self-learner who joined the Manipal Online BCA program.  
> I needed transcripts to revise easily offline — so I made this tool.  
> If you're also a Manipal student struggling to find transcripts, this is for you.
